== Description ==

YouTube Post Type allows you to easily add YouTube videos as post into your WordPress installation via the introduction of register_post_type in WordPress v2.9. This will make YouTube a first class citizen in your WordPress.

Why would you want to do this? If you want a post to represent a YouTube video.

You add YouTube videos by specifying the URL or the YouTube id.

Your YouTube thumbnails are also downloaded and pulled into the system so you can use them. Your YouTube also gets associated to the first thumbnail found.

== How It Works ==

YouTube Post Type allows a WordPress post to represent a YouTube video via WordPress custom post types. This makes YouTube a first class citizen, and easily extensible by other plugins.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `youtube_post_type` folder into your plugin directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

If you want to create a custom theme page for YouTube posts. Inside your theme you are required to create a file called `single-youtube.php`.

== Why I Created It ==

Shortcomings of other YouTube plugins:

1. Most of them were to embed YouTube video via a WordPress shortcode
1. None of them detailed how the plugin worked to support a YouTube as a post.
